## Brain Trainer

Brain Trainer was a side project with the following goals in mind:
* Learn Android programming
* Learn about Google Ads
* Learn about Google Play Store and Amazon app store

Brain Trainer was written in about 4 weeks around Dec 13 - Jan 14 with other projects going on at the same time.  Lots of things could be improved!:
* All image assets are XML shapes to avoid trying to be a designer
* Git commits are bad.  When I wrote this, I didn't know about git rebase and git's -p flag
* Screen support could be better
